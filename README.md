# Infinite Craft Ingredient Manager

Wouldn't it be cool if you could share all of the ingredients you've found in [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft) with friends? Or wish that you had some of the ingredients they did so you could discover new stuff on your own?

*Well now you can!*

With the *Infinite Craft Ingredient Manager* browser extension you can download your ingredients as a file and merge it with similar files from your friends! Once you have the new, merged file, you can use the `Import` button to put it into your browser and get back to crafting!

# Merging files

To merge ingredient files from your friends into your own, you can use [this website](https://infinite-craft-ingredient-manager.pages.dev/). Simply upload your file in the top zone, and everyone else's files in the bottom zone. Once the files are in, hit `Merge` and then `Download Merged File`. Lastly, take your new file and use this extension to import it and you're good to go!

## Notes
This extension is using Manifest V2. Chrome is about to deprecate this in favor of V3 in June 2024, while Firefox has decided to support V2 for the forseeable future. Because of this, the extension will work in Chrome until that date (hopefully I'll get around to converting it before then)
